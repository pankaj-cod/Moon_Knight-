# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Project Proposal
**Problem Statement**: Users need a simple, intuitive web application to edit photos and organize them into albums. Existing tools are either too complex or lack organizational features.
**Solution**: Moonlight is a web-based photo editor that allows users to upload, edit (adjust brightness, contrast, etc.), and save photos. It also provides an "Albums" feature to organize these edits.
**Features**:
- User Authentication (Signup/Login)
- Photo Editor (Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, etc.)
- Save Edits to Cloud
- Organize Edits into Albums
- Advanced Search and Filtering for Edits and Albums
